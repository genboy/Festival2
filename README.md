# Festival2
Pocketmine Festival 2 plugin - the remake project

Actually, a complete new setup to provide better control and less overhead, ingame and incode.

So this where it's at;

- testing custom UIs for easy controls
- add option to use Festival in specified levels 
- moving level default configurations from configs to main control (like area's)
- split code to separate classes and files 

What would be cool?
A future feature todo list 

- Festival API ! Hooking everything up and down, maybe 1 for ingame events and 1 for control
- Translation! incl. auto player lang set
- A Control Panel! (Forms API) 
- More Area Creation options (like 1 tab and size/direction input like BlockSniper) 
- Better world Flag / Permission functionality 
- New Flags in a new flag system 
- and more tools.
